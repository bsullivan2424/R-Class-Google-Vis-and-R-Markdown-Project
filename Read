This file was made in R using R Markdown for a class project. The data used was downloaded from: 
https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2019-us-vehicle-sales-figures-by-model/

The website provided Auto sales by make and model for every month in 2019. I used R to clean up the data and format data tables in the
correct form to work for the Google Vis charts I wanted to display.

The file shows all makes and models rolled up to show how sales varied in 2019 each month. It also shows the top 10 makes to compare to
eachother.

There are sections for each Make to compare their models sales in 2019. You can also see how sales varied for the make by month in the line
graphs.
